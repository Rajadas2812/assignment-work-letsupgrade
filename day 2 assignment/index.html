                   <p class="para">Modern technology has paved the way for multi-functional devices like the smartwatch and the smartphone. Computers are increasingly faster, more portable, and higher-powered than ever before. With all of these revolutions, technology has also made our lives easier, faster, better, and more fun.<br>

                    Social media has changed not only our powers of thinking, but today governs our behavior and social conducts as well.<br>
                    
                    
                    Today, social media has created new styles of communication for us, which made huge impact on everyday lives of the people. Social media has brought people with common interests together and expanded the horizon of ideas worldwide. However, there has also been an impact of social media on human behavior and society.
                    
                    Human behavior changes more when we dabble with technology especially with social media. The daily use of social media by people has increased so much that it is slowly injecting an inflection into our behaviors.

                   <p class="para2"> As walk, drive, vacation, dine, or even watch a movie in the theater, it is painfully noticeable that most individuals are engaged in their smartphones. With groups of teenagers in particular, you may notice that each one of them has a smartphone not far from arm’s length. This is because teenagers fall victim to yet another vice: social media. With apps such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat; there is a constant feed of information, fads, and mind numbing entertainment. The internet and app world has enfeebled teenage social skills, as well as physical and mental health.
                    Teenage social media addiction has become so severe that it has been classified as a “behavioral disorder.” Social media addictions affect chemical processes in the brain. When a “like,” “retweet,” “follow,” or notification is received; the reward system in the brain is triggered. There is a rush of dopamine, which creates a “type of high.” Studies have shown that teenagers feel pressured to show off their on their ‘best self’ on social media pages; which, in turn, reduces self esteem. This self esteem reduction often leads to more severe disorders: depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self harming behaviors, and even substance abuse.
                    Social media addiction in teenagers takes a toll on more than the individual teen being affected by it. The addiction creates strained relationships with family members and possibly friends, trouble in school, and a constant feeling of being distracted and anxious. Being addicted to communication with the Internet world by smartphone is debilitating in terms of being a functional human and communicating with the present world around you.
